## üìÑ Prerequisite

There various methods to make a Pok√©mon fangames. The most notable ones are:

- Using [Pok√©mon Essentials](https://pokemon-fan-game.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Essentials), A base [RPG Maker XP](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-xp) project that comes with its own debugger, map connector and alot of free tools, It is community driven project, and is always up-to-date! RPG-Maker-XP only compiles games to Windows, so these are essentially Windows only games!
- By [ROM Hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM_hacking), These are created by editing the base ROM of _legally owned_ Pok√©mon game, We will be taking only [GameBoy Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) and [Nintendo DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS) in account, since they have the most used games as base Image. These Fangames are made for their respective console, but can be played on any device using [Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator)!

## üíº About

<p align="center">
<i><b>"</b>Those who play Pok√©mon Games, typically have alot of them<b>"</b></i>  ~ My Experience
</p>

**Pok√©Shelf** is a living gallery that hosts all games downloaded/installed by the User, May it be _Essentials_ game or GBx/NDS ROM!

- Pok√©Shelf itself is themed like a Pok√©mon game menu, with almost no mouse input and key bindings similar to _Emulators_ and _Essentials_ game, all this to maintain the Immersion.
- Once Configured, Play Games Directly from PokeShelf, even the ones that require Emulator!
- You can Add Custom Background Image/Video and Custom Music for each fangame.
- Auto Add functionality for BG and Music for most of the _Essentials_ Games, To enable this functionality with ROMs or with your incompatible _Essentials_ Game, Check the [Auto-Add Guide](#-auto-add-functionality).
- Lastly, A Quit-to-Tray Option, if required, _I personally never used It._
